# üêç Python Practice and Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks focused on practicing Python programming and implementing basic machine learning models. It includes datasets, model files, and various practice scripts to aid in learning and experimentation.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - `Real_Estates.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating a machine learning model for real estate price prediction.
  - `testing.ipynb`: A notebook for testing and experimentation purposes.

- **Python Scripts:**
  - `tut1.py` to `tut21.py`: A series of tutorial scripts covering various Python programming concepts and exercises.
  - `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`: Temporary script file, possibly used for quick code testing.

- **Data Files:**
  - `housing.csv`: Dataset used for training the real estate prediction model.
  - `friends.csv`: A CSV file, contents unspecified.
  - `reet.xlsx`: An Excel file, contents unspecified.
  - `file.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt`, `records.txt`: Text files, contents unspecified.

- **Model File:**
  - `Realestates.joblib`: Serialized machine learning model for real estate price prediction.

- **Image File:**
  - `picture2.jpg`: An image file, purpose unspecified.
